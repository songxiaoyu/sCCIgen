\usage{
cell.loc.fc(
  N,
  win,
  cell.prop,
  cell.inh.attr.input = NULL,
  same.dis.cutoff = 0,
  even.distribution.coef = 0,

}
\arguments{
\item{N}{No. of cells to generate.}

\item{win}{Spatial window within which cells will be generated.}

\item{cell.prop}{Proportion of cell in each cell type to generated for each region.}

\item{cell.inh.attr.input}{(Default=NULL). A matrix providing cell-cell location
attraction and inhibition parameters. Example input is like: cell.inh.attr.input=
cbind(Cell1=c("A", "B", "C"), Cell2=c("B","D","E), Strength= c(2, 0, -2)).}

\item{same.dis.cutoff}{(Default = 0) Cells with distance less than this cutoff
will be considered as overlapping cells non-realistic in real ST data,
and only one will be kept.}

\item{even.distribution.coef}{(Default =0). The higher the value, the more we
require evenly distributed locations of cells, as opposed to randomly generated
locations (Poisson process).}

\item{grid.size.small}{(Default =19). If some levels of even distributions of cells are imposed,
this parameter is needed to cut the simulation window into grids of different
sizes to smooth cell densities.}

\item{grid.size.large}{(Default =45). If some levels of even distributions of cells are imposed,
this parameter is needed to cut the simulation window into grids of different
sizes to smooth cell densities.}

\item{seed}{Random seed}

\value{
